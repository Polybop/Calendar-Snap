# Privacy Policy for Calendar Snap

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

## Overview

Calendar Snap ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Photos and Images
- **What we collect:** Calendar Snap accesses your device camera and photo library to capture or select images of calendars and schedules.
- **How we use it:** Images are temporarily sent to our secure backend server for AI-powered text recognition and event extraction using OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API.
- **Storage:** Images are NOT permanently stored on our servers. They are processed in memory and immediately discarded after event extraction is complete.

### Calendar Data
- **What we collect:** Calendar Snap requests permission to read and write to your device's calendar.
- **How we use it:** This permission allows the app to add extracted events directly to your selected calendar on your device.
- **Storage:** Calendar data remains entirely on your device. We do NOT access, collect, or store your existing calendar information.

### Processing Data
- **Temporary transmission:** When you process a photo, the image is sent via secure HTTPS connection to our backend server (calendar.chrisstirling.com) for AI analysis.
- **AI Processing:** The image is analyzed by OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API to extract event information (titles, dates, times, locations).
- **No retention:** Neither our server nor OpenAI retains your images after processing is complete.

- **Camera:** To capture photos of calendars

## Data Retention
